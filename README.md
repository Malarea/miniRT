# miniRT

### Description
**miniRT** is a simplified ray tracing engine developed as part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum. The project involves rendering 3D scenes by simulating light rays to produce realistic images. The challenge is to build a ray tracer from scratch in C, with minimal external libraries, adhering to strict coding standards. This project deepens understanding of 3D mathematics, vector operations, and low-level graphics programming.

### Features
- Basic geometric shapes: spheres, planes, and cylinders
- Light management: ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
- Ray-object intersection detection
- Shadows and reflections
- BMP image output
- Minimal external libraries (only using the MinilibX library)
